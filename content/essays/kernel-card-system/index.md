I've been hopping from one productivity system to another for years:

* Seinfeld Chains
* GTD
* Autofocus
* Final Version
* Mini-habits
* Unscheduling
* The One Thing
* Weighted random sampling
* HabitBull
* Beeminder
* *and many, many more*

I've even designed my own productivity software. "[HabitShaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzlw-vrG1-E)", which is now abandonded. And "Stride", a task manager based on how CPU's juggle and complete tasks, which I never completed.

All this leap-frogging has just been perfectionism, of course. I know that more important than which system I choose is **whether I stick to any system** long enough to see the benefits. Seneca said it best:

> "Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment; a wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different ointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing."<br>
> &mdash; *Seneca, Letter II*

But how bad has it been, really? Well, I recently found my New Year's resolutions from when I was 15:

There was a lot for me to parse in this list, including my atrocious handwriting. But one thing was clear to me: writing short stories regularly has been a goal of mine for decades, yet my longest streak was around 3 months.

It wasn't until 2017 that I finally created a system I could stick to. I've now been using it for the last 18 months. That's *6 times longer* than any other I've used or designed, and worked despite living through one of the most difficult times we've had as a family.

How did I finally manage to achieve consistency?

The key was realizing that I over all these years, I was focusing on **exactly the wrong thing**...


## Pushing in the Wrong Direction

It's an aphorism in Systems Thinking that people often know which lever to push to have the biggest impact. The problem is that they tend to want to push that lever very hard *in the wrong direction*.

`What was missing in the systems I tried wasn't more *consistency*, it was more *flexibility*.`

In every other system I'd tried, the only way to change my mind was by admitting defeat and starting over, or by abandoning the system altogether. In other words, to change you have to go through a system failure : either **break a streak** or **give up on the habit**.

Doing that lowered my confidence in that particular system, and in myself. Worse, I'd been in this cycle so many times that I eventually became afraid of even *starting* a committment (for fear of failing yet again).

Perfectionism aside, it's also entirely *rational* to want a system to be flexible. I've been through a great number of life changes, and I know that sticking to old behaviors and goals isn't always sensible. It's important not to get stuck in "foolish consistencies":

> "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines... Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today."<br>
> &mdash; *Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance*


But isn't a habit-forming system that allows you to change your mind at will a *total contradiction*?

Not necessarily. With two simple changes, we can have both.

### Step 1 : Introduce a Delay

`To have both flexibility and consistency, simply introduce a *delay* between the *decision* to change and the *act* of changing.`
