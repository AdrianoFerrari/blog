I recently found my New Year's Resolutions from 1999, at age 15:

{{< figure src="resolutions-1999.jpg" title="\"1999 will be great if I follow these rules\". Spoiler alert : I didn't." width="500px" >}}

There was a lot for me to parse in this list, including the atrocious handwriting. But one thing stood out to me:

> My resolution to write short stories regularly
> <br>is *still unmet 20 years later*.

Ouch! That's a depressing thought [1].

And it's not for lack of trying. In the decades since, I've tried dozens of the popular habit-forming techniques, with hundreds of variations each. From Seinfeld chains to (Mini|Tiny|Atomic)-habits, as well as larger systems like GTD, and apps like Beeminder, Habitica, Loop, and many *many* others than I can't remember. I've even developed and sold my own habit-tracking software[2].

But nothing would ever stick.

Until now, that is. I've been using the same system for a year and a half (6 times longer than any other I've used or designed). More importantly, the nagging sense of doubt about whether it's the "right" system for me is gone, and I can now focus not on *how* to achieve my goals, but on *what* those goals should be.

All it took was to realize what critical piece was missing from other systems, and fill in that gap.

## The Dilemma
After much journaling and reflection, I came to a realization : 

> As a struggling perfectionist, and as a generalist, I was *afraid* of suceeding at the "wrong" habit!

Rationally I know that not choosing is worse that choosing incorrectly. I also know that no matter what, I can always change my mind later.

But therein lies the problem. The only way to change my mind was by abandoning the system, or admitting defeat and starting over. In other words, to change you have to go through failure : either break a streak or delete the habit.

Doing that lowered my confidence in that particular system, and in myself. Worse, I'd been in this cycle so many times that I eventually became afraid of even starting a committment (for fear of failing yet again).

Habits, by definition, require consistency. But to ease my fears, and allow for adaptation, I require flexibility. This dilemma is captured by these two opposing views, both of which are deeply true:

> "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today."
- Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance.

[In other words, only a fool values consistency for its own sake. When discovering that a certain consistency isn't valuable, the right thing to do is to change.]

> "Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment; a wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different ointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing."
- Seneca, Letter II

[Then again, it takes time to discover if something is valuable or not. So don't change too hastily.]

Once I phrased the dilemma in this way, the resolution was relatively easy. I just had to pluck two ideas from the only habit systems I've seen where flexibility is inherent to their designs.

## The "Kernel Card" System
Alright, enough musing. Here is the system I've been using, in full.

The basic idea is to **write an index card each day with all your required yes/no habits**. 
Nothing special there.

[But the trick is really in using two different concepts... add akrasia and allowed slips here]

The trick is in the *specific rules* for how you *add*, *remove*, or *modify* your habit list. Here are the rules:

1. Every habit has a date attached to it, and you cannot make *any* changes to the habit until that date. That means you cannot drop it, or even reword it, until that date.
2. When adding a habit, the starting "delay date" is set to two days from today.
3. Every day, you copy down the habits from the day before, and you increase the "delay date" by *two days*.
4. If you decide to drop a habit, you write "drop :" followed by the habits current delay date. Until the drop date, you continue the habit as before (including increasing the delay date). As long as you don't change your mind at any point, and you continue to carry the "drop : [drop date]" through to the drop date, you can drop the habit without guilt. If, however, you change your mind at any point, then simply cross out the "drop" info and continue as normal. Note that once you've crossed it out, you'll need to set a new drop-date if you change your mind back and decide again to drop it.
5. Finally, if you fail a habit on a given day, add a "2/3 :" followed by the current delay date. That means you have 2 more slips allowed on this habit, and you get to recover one more slip on the delay date.

## Flexibility to Change - The Akrasia Horizon
> To have both flexibility and consistency, simply introduce a *delay* between the *decision* to change and the *act* of changing.

This is a simple, but incredibly powerful, idea. The delay removes the instant gratification that changing often provides.

"Sure, you can decide to switch from jogging to pushups, but you're still on the hook with jogging for another 8 days."

I won't go into more detail, since the originators of this idea have done so many times. I encourage you to check out their writing on this, if you're interested in the concept.

## Flexibility to Fail - Allowed Slips
Winning streaks are fantastic motivation to continue. But breaking a streak is an instant derailment of your motivation.

[95% vs 100%] Bullshit. It's this 100% mentality that makes it frightening to even start.

That's why I allow myself 3 slip ups, which regenerate at ever-slowing rates. The mechanics of this is explained below.

## Footnotes
* [1] - When I first saw this list, I felt somewhat sad and disappointed. My wife helped me see that in fact, I have achieved many of the goals listed. And for writing and exercise, knowing that they've been goals of mine since then can be seen as reinforcing how important they are to me. That's a good reminder for when I start to doubt that.
