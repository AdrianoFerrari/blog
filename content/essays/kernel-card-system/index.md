I've been hopping from one productivity system to another for years:

* Seinfeld Chains
* GTD
* Autofocus
* Final Version
* Mini-habits
* Unscheduling
* The One Thing
* HabitBull
* Beeminder
* *and many, many more*

I've even designed my own productivity software. "[HabitShaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzlw-vrG1-E)", which is now abandonded. And "Stride", a task manager based on how CPU's juggle and complete tasks of varying priorities, which I never completed *(I know, The irony is not lost on me)*.

All this leap-frogging has just been perfectionism, of course. I know that more important than which system I choose is **whether I stick to any system** long enough to see the benefits:

> "Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment; a wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different ointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing."<br>
> &mdash; *Seneca, Letter II*

But how bad has it been, really? Well, I recently found my New Year's resolutions from when I was 15:

There was a lot for me to parse in this list, including my atrocious handwriting. But one thing was clear to me: I've been struggling with consistency for almost 20 years.

It wasn't until 2017 that I finally created a system I could stick to. I've now been using it for 18 months. In case you're not impressed, that's *6 times longer* than any other I've used or designed.

`The key was realizing that I over all these years, I was focusing on **exactly the wrong thing**...`


## The Key to Consistency
