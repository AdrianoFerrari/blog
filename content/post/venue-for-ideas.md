+++

I am continually producing, modifying, discarding, and reviving ideas. At the same time, I know that bringing ideas to life is a *very* long road, based on my experiences with [Gingko](https://gingkoapp.com), my PhD, and projects before then.

> But that doesn't mean that ideas   themselves have no value. They do.

This is my venue for sharing my ideas openly. Without fear, and without expectation of reward. I believe deeply that we can all live better if we did so.
